Mash water quantity: 29 lb. grain X 1.25 quarts/lb. = ~36 quarts

Strike water temperature:
Tw = (.2/r)(T2-T1)+T2
Tw = (.2/1.25)(152-70)+152
Tw = .16 X 82 + 152
Tw = 165.1 F

Mash at 152 F for 90 minutes
Sparge with 170 F water to obtain ~13 gallons
Boil for 75 minutes

Yeah, it's a lot of hops. But it's pretty close to SNCA. I get about 27 p/p/g with this recipe, you may want to adjust your grain bill. The 120L crystal adds a caramel sweetness and color that is characteristic of SNCA. Dryhopping is a necessity to pick up the centennial nose. Enjoy! Email me if you try this, I'd like to hear how it goes.

Procedure:
Mash at 152F 90 minutes

Mash water quantity: 14.5 lb. grain X 1.25 quarts/lb. + 4.5 = ~22.5 quarts

Water to grain ratio: 22.5 / 14.5 = 1.55 quarts/lb.

Strike water temperature:
Tw = (.2/r)(T2-T1)+T2
Tw = (.2/1.55)(152-70)+152
Tw = .13 X 82 + 152
Tw = 162.5 F

2:50 Dough in. Worried about the temperature falling too low during the mash and let the strike water get up to about 166, resulting in an initial mash temperature of about 156. Began sparge after about 75 minutes with 170 water. I think we used too much water to sparge, as we ended up with perhaps a bit more than 8 gallons of wort before without fully draining the mash. Added about 8 gallons to the boil kettle and discarded a couple quarts or so of wort.

4:33 Begin boil
5:12 Hot break
6:17 Begin cooling

Cooled for about 30 minutes until the temperature fell to about 75. Draining into fermenter provided ample aeration, judging from the thick layer of foam on the top. Original gravity: 1.050 at ~70 = 1.051.

That's a Lot of Hops!

OG: 1.050 at 70 = 1.051
