All temperatures in Farenheit

Planned procedure:
Mash at 150° to 152° for 60 min.
Sparge with 165°-175° water to obtain about 12.5 gallons of wort
Boil for 90 minutes
Ferment at 64-75° for Weihenstephan, 58-74º for American


Mash water quantity: 9 lb. grain X 1.25 quarts/lb. + 4.5 = 16 quarts

Water to grain ratio: 16 / 9 = 1.78 quarts/lb.

Strike water temperature:
Tw = (.2/r)(T2-T1)+T2
Tw = (.2/1.78)(152-70)+152
Tw = .11 X 82 + 152
Tw = 161.2° F
