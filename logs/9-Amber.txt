3  lb Munich malt (Briess Organic)
2  lb 60 L Crystal malt (Breiss)
4  oz roasted barley (Hugh Baird)

Wyeast 1028 London Ale™


Mash at 150° to 155° F for one hour
Sparge with 165°-175° water to obtain about 13.5 gallons of wort
Boil for 60 minutes
Add hops according to schedule


Mash water: 22.5 lb. grain X 1.25 quarts/lb. = 28 quarts = 7 gallons
Target total wort: 10 boiled wort + .5 boiled hops absorption + 3 boiloff = 13.5 gallons
Sparge water: 13.5 - 7 + 2 mash absorbtion = 8.5 gallons
Total water quantity: 7 + 8.5 = 15.5 gallons

Strike water temperature:
Tw = (.2/r)(T2-T1)+T2
Tw = (.2/1.25)(152-70)+152
Tw = .16 X 82 + 152
Tw = 165° F

Next time:
Allow for more impact of cold ambient temperature on strike water temperature -- strike with hotter water when it's cold outside!
