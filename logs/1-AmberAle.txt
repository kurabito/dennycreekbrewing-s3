Amber Ale, adapted from Bob's Homebrew Supply recipe:

8.5 lb. 2-row (Gambrinus)
1.5 lb. Munich malt (Briess Organic)
1 lb. 60 L Crystal malt (Breiss)
2 oz. roasted barley (Hugh Baird)
1.5 oz. Chocolate malt (Hugh Baird)

2 oz. Cascade hops (60 min.)
1 oz. Cascade hops (last 5 min.)
1 oz. Cascade hops (last 1 min.)

1028 London ale


1:39  Started heating mash water.
2:15  Transfer water to mash tun.
2:25  Dough-in complete.  Temperature at 154° F.

Temperature held steady until the first stirring of the mash at 2:40, when it dropped to 149° and held steady there.  This may have been due to the stirring spoon being rinsed in cold water before being returned to the mash tun.  Added a teapot full of hot water near the end of the mash, but it didn't raise the temperature much.

3:35  Begin sparge.

Ken brought over the bottling bucket and we used that as as sparge water dispenser.  It was much easier using a gravity feed instead of ladling in the sparge water as we have done in the past.

3:55  Start heating wort.
4:18  Begin boil.  Added 2 oz. Cascade hops.
5:13  Added 1 oz. Cascade hops.
5:17  Added 1 oz. Cascade hops.
5:18  Begin cooling wort.
5:50  Pitched yeast.

OG: 1.042 at 75° = 1.044.  Seems a little low.
