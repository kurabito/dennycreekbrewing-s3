Boil for 120-180 minutes
Add hops 60 minutes before end of boil
Ferment at 62° to 65° F

Mash water: 18 lb. grain X 1.25 quarts/lb. = 22.5 quarts = ~ 5.5 gallons
Target total wort: 10 boiled wort + .1 boiled hops absorption + 4 boiloff = 14.1 gallons
Sparge water: 14.1 - 5.5 + 2 mash absorbtion = 10.6 gallons
Total water quantity: 5.5 + 10.6 = 16.1 gallons

Strike water temperature:
Tw = (.2/r)(T2-T1)+T2
Tw = (.2/1.25)(152-70)+152
Tw = .16 X 82 + 152
Tw = 165° F
