Sparge with 165°-175° water to obtain about 13.5 gallons of wort
Boil for 60 minutes
Ferment at 60° to 72° F


Mash water quantity: 24 lb. grain X 1.25 quarts/lb. = 30 quarts = 7.5 gallons
Target total wort: 10 boiled wort + .5 boiled hops absorption + 2.5 boiloff = 13 gallons
Sparge water: 13 - 7.5 + 2 mash absorbtion = 7.5 gallons
Total water quantity: 7.5 + 7.5 = 15 gallons

Strike water temperature:
Tw = (.2/r)(T2-T1)+T2
Tw = (.2/1.25)(152-50)+152
Tw = .16 X 102 + 152
Tw = 168° F
